# Image Search Engine

The "Image Search Web" project is a dynamic web application designed to provide users with a seamless and visually engaging experience in discovering high-quality images. Developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project leverages the power of the Unsplash free API to fetch diverse and copyright-free images based on user-entered keywords.

   - Developed a solid understanding of HTML by creating a well-structured and semantically meaningful webpage. Mastered the usage of HTML tags for creating a foundational structure.

2. CSS Styling and Design:
   - Acquired proficiency in CSS for styling and designing user interfaces. Applied styling techniques to achieve a visually appealing layout, including centered titles, styled forms, and grid-based image displays.

3. JavaScript for Dynamic Functionality:
   - Implemented dynamic functionality using JavaScript to interact with the Unsplash API. Gained expertise in making asynchronous API calls, parsing JSON responses, and dynamically updating the webpage based on user interactions.

4. API Integration (Unsplash API):

5. Event Handling and DOM Manipulation:
   - Demonstrated proficiency in event handling and DOM manipulation in JavaScript. Implemented click events for the search button and "Load More" button, dynamically updating the webpage content.
